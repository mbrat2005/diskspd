## The DiskSpd Storage Performance Tool

DiskSpd is a highly customizable I/O load generator tool that can be used to run storage performance tests against files, partitions, or physical disks. DiskSpd can generate a wide variety of disk request patterns for use in analyzing and diagnosing storage performance issues without running a full end-to-end workload. You can simulate SQL Server I/O activity or more complex, changing access patterns, returning detailed XML output for use in automated results analysis.

## Vision for the DiskSpd tool
The DiskSpd tool provides the functionality needed to generate a wide variety of disk request patterns, helpful in diagnosis and analysis of storage-based performance issues. For example, it can be used to simulate SQL Server I/O activity and more complex patterns of access which change over time. It enables the user to analyze storage performance without running a full end-to-end workload.

DiskSpd presents results in both a text summary and also a detailed XML form suitable for automated result analysis.
